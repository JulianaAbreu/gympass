## Description

This project allows you to view repositories and commits of the user "reactjs" according to user search parameters.

The technologies used were React, redux and redux-pack (middleware for redux) to handle asynchronous requests handling, styled-components (CSS-in-JS), Jest + Enzyme to tests unit and ESLint + Prettier as linter.

## ES6+ features
#### Destructuring
Used to facilitate access to data within an array or object and to create variables that contain this data. This feature leave the code shorter and clearer.

#### Spread operator
Used to combine arrays, set values ​​of the prior state of the reducer, and to set values ​​to arrays or objects in general.

#### Async/await
Used to work with asynchronous code, as in calling a function that returns a promise. This way it is simpler and leaves the code clear.

#### Arrow functions
allows writing functions without losing the current "this" scope and leaving the code shorter.
